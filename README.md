# E-redux-commerce

Welcome to my React Native project! This application was built to showcase my skills and expertise in mobile development. I used the Redux library and followed the concepts of Clean Architecture to ensure that the code is maintainable and scalable.

To install and run the app on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the app:

```
npm start
```

Once the app is running, you can either use an emulator or scan the QR code using the Expo app to view the app on your mobile device.

I've connected it with a REST API that provides access to a variety of products. My app uses the fakestoreapi.com API, which means you can browse through a wide range of items and view their details right within the app.
